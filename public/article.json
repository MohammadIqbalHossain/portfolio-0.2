Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles based on the device's screen size, orientation, and resolution. For example, you can use a media query to adjust the layout for screens smaller than 600px. Another practice is to use flexible grid layouts with CSS Grid or Flexbox, which allow you to create adaptable and fluid layouts. Additionally, consider using responsive units like percentages, ems, and rems instead of fixed units like pixels. These practices ensure that your website looks great on any device.",

You can use these storage options to store user preferences, form data, and other information that needs to persist across page reloads. The data is stored as key-value pairs, and you can use methods like setItem, getItem, and removeItem to manage the data. Web storage is a simple and efficient way to improve the performance and user experience of your web applications.",
